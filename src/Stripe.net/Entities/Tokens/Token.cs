    /// Tokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account
    /// details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a
    /// secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use.
    /// You should use our <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/payments">recommended payments
    /// integrations</a> to perform this process client-side. This ensures that no sensitive
    /// card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant
    /// way.
    ///
    /// If you cannot use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API
    /// with either your publishable or secret API key. Keep in mind that if your integration
    /// uses this method, you are responsible for any PCI compliance that may be required, and
    /// you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your
    /// customer's information is not sent directly to Stripe, so we cannot determine how it is
    /// handled or stored.
    ///
    /// Tokens cannot be stored or used more than once. To store card or bank account
    /// information for later use, you can create <a
    /// href="https://stripe.com/docs/api#customers">Customer</a> objects or <a
